CS-220 Spring 2018 Homework 5			Due: Mar. 18, 2018

1. Given the C expression: float x=-19.625; 

	A. What is the value for the sign bit of x?
	   >The value for the sign bit of x is 1, because x is negative
	
	B. What is the binary representation of 19.625, using a binary point
	   instead of a decimal point?
	   >The binary representation of 19.625 using binary point is:
		10011.101
	   
	C. What is the representation of 19.625 in normalized binary scientific
	   notation?
	   >The representation of 19.625 in normalized binary scientific notation
		is:
		(-1 ^ 0) * 001 1101 0000 0000 0000 0000 * (2 ^ 131)
	
	D. What is the unbiased value of the exponent in the C representation?
	   >The unbiased value of the exponent in the C representation is:
		4
	
	E. What is the biased value of the exponent in the C representation of
	   19.625?
	   >The biased value of the exponent in the C representation of 19.625
		is:
		4 + 127 = 131
	   
	F. What are the concrete fraction bits in the binary representation of x?
	   >The concrete fraction bits in the binary representation of x are:
		0011 1010 0000... (The '...' represents all continuing zeros until the
		FRAC field is filled. Also, the '1.' is not included because it is 
		implied.)
	
	G. What is the hexadecimal concrete representation of x?
	   >The hexadcimal concrete representation of x is:
		419d0000
	
2. Given the following code:

	union flint { 
		float xf;
		unsigned int xi;
	} fl;
	fl.xi=0x42c8000;
	printf("xf=%.3f\n",fl.xf);
	
	What will get printed to standard output?
	>I would have expected the float value of 345.000 to be printed to
	 standard output, but when I ran the code, it printed the float value
	 0.000. My original response was based off of re-working the IEEE standard
	 backwards, but it is possible that the program prints 0.000 becasue the binary
	 number specified in the code rounds very close to 0.
